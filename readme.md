* At the 20th of June, you will be presenting the results of your work, then we'll decide if you're good enough

### How to win?
It's not only about "doing a certain thing you're told to do".
Try to think forward, make suggestions on how a certain product/idea
you're working on could be developed further, tell us about the
observations you've made while working on your task.

We appreciate the people who explore the domain of the problem
